# Matrix Completion in Recommender Systems

This repository implements matrix completion algorithms for recommender systems as part of an Optimization for Data Science project.

## Files

- **`group_7_project_ODS.ipynb`** - Main notebook containing real dataset experiments and preprocessing
- **`matrix_completion_functions.py`** - Core algorithm implementations and utility functions  
- **`paper_group7.pdf`** - Technical paper summarizing algorithms and results
- **`SLIDES_ODS_1_group7.pdf`** - Slides used for project presentation

## Overview

The project implements and compares various matrix completion methods for predicting missing entries in user-item rating matrices. Experiments are conducted on real-world recommendation datasets with comprehensive performance evaluation.

## Usage

1. Import functions from `matrix_completion_functions.py` 
2. Run `group_7_project_ODS.ipynb` for dataset experiments
3. Refer to `paper_group7.pdf` for detailed algorithm descriptions and results

## Requirements

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
